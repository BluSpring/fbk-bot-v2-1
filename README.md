# fbk-bot-v2-1
An editable bot used originally for TheFoozBallTable server discord.


# How to install
First off, install Node.JS and a coding software like Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code, along with Git.

# Step 2
Next, download the files. Once Node.JS is finished installing, open up Command Prompt and type "cd <file location>", example: "cd C:\Users\ASUS\FBK Bot v2\FoozBallKing Bot v2.1". If the file location is in a different drive, type the letters. For example, it's in your F: drive. So type "F:" in command prompt.

# Installing the modules
After doing that, type "npm install discord.js node-opus --save". Next, type "npm install uws --save". Next, type "npm install libsodium-wrappers --save". Next, type "npm install bufferutil --save". Next, type "npm install fs --save". Finally, type "npm install ytdl-core --save".

# Setting up the bot
First, go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me 
This will come in helpful. https://twentysix26.github.io/Red-Docs/red_guide_bot_accounts/#creating-a-new-bot-account
After you're done with that, copy the token and paste it into the area which says "BOT_TOKEN". Next, copy the client ID of your bot and paste it over FBK Bot's client ID in both "client_id" and "bot_id". After that, go into Developer Mode in Discord and copy your ID. Now, paste it over my ID in the "Owner_ID" path. Next, copy your username (with the tag) and paste it into "owner_username". Now, change the bot's prefix. You should also change the bot name in the "bot_name" path.
For now, don't bother about the GAPI key. It's not useful yet. It is recommended for you to keep copies of the bot. You should also look through the commands in the code. Not every command is listed in the help command just yet.

# Turning it on
If you're done with everything, type "node ." in command prompt. It shouldn't give any errors and show you the info. If there are errors, you must have done something wrong.

# Setting up commands
Don't bother asking me. Just, copy the command codes and just edit them. For more info, read the docs here: https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome
